      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Megan O'Donnell and I am proud to be the Chair of the Notre Dame High School Senior Fashion Show. The Notre Dame High School Senior Fashion Show Committee is hosting its 13th
        Annual Fashion Show on Wednesday, March 18, 2020 and this will be my 6th consecutive year as the Chairperson of this special event!
      </p>

      <p> My husband and I are both alumni of Notre Dame High School as are my three oldest children. My youngest daughter is currently a senior, and this will be my final year running the Senior
        Fashio Show. As a parent, I know first hand how special these types of events are, and my biggest goal is to make this a special night for all parents with a senior in this year's
        graduating class. I also love having the opportunity to work with so many of these parents on my Fashion Show Committee Team.
      </p>

      <p>Proceeds from the Senior Fashion Show are used exclusively to fund Notre Dameâ€™s Post Prom celebration, which provides our seniors with an all-night, adult-supervised party free of alcohol
        and drugs. This after prom party offers seniors the opportunity to enjoy music, food, games, and prizes with their friends and eliminates many of the risks often associated with post prom parties.

      <h2>Announcements</h2>
      <p>Reminder to purchase your tickets and RSVP as early as possible but NO LATER than March 1st! This is typically a sold out event with more than 450 parents, friends and supporters in attendance, and we have limited seating available in the gymnasium. First come, first serve and NO tickets will be sold at the door! </p>
      <p>Attention Seniors: Sign up deadline is January 1, 2020! Be sure to have your applications filled out and turned into the main office by this deadline. We will, unfortunately, not be able to accomodate students who turn in their forms late.</p>
      <p>Attention Senior Girls: Be sure to be checking your emails for your dress fitting time and location! It is so important that you show up to your assigned boutique on time and with a cooperative and excited attitude! These stores have been so generous with their time and with their dresses!</p>

      This is not an event you want to miss out on, for it will be a memorable night with your senior class!</p>
